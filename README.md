Hi, I'm Alessio Nalesso.
I enjoy programming and I would like to take part in open source projects to help others with development and to learn how open source software is developed collectively, as well as to improve my programming skills.
In addition to programming, I also enjoy computer networking so much that I have acquired the Cisco CCNA certification.
I am currently studying Python and C/C++.
